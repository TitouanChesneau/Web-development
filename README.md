# Web-development
This will be the repository on which i will show my web development skills

In the first project called Epytodo, the goal was to manage a database with Javascript. It also was my first ever javascript project.

In the second project called My_web, the goal is to get back to basics with a simple website. Keep in mind that this is far from his last version. It is working with Xampp if you want to try it by yourself.

In the third project, the goal was to create something related to agriculture. It was an event in November 2021, which lasted 2 days (also one of our first HTML project ever).

The last project for now on, is a discovery of Reactjs, still in progress.
