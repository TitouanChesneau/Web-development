# Web-development
This will be the repository on which i will show my web development skills

In the first project called Epytodo, the goal was to manage a database with Javascript. It also was my first ever javascript project.

In the second project called My_web, the goal is to get back to basics with a simple website. Keep in mind that this is far from his last version. It is working with Xampp if you want to try it by yourself.

In the third project, the goal was to create something related to agriculture. It was an event in November 2021, which lasted 2 days (also one of our first HTML project ever).

The reactjs_app is a classic porte folio that is my first Reactjs project.

The reactjs_jim is a website, containing tips and help for your gym routine, if you have one. You can find multiples exercises, and how to do them.

Feel free to contact me on titouan.chesneau@oulook.fr if you have any questions.
